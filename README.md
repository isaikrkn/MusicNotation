**Music Metrics Solver Bot**
**Project Overview**

The Music Metrics Solver Bot is a JavaScript application designed to analyze and solve metric problems in music generated by AI. This project is a part of the 2020 GitHub Archive Program and is actively maintained and updated. Our current goal is to enhance the application's functionality by transcribing the existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, adding new features, and integrating advanced music notation rendering using the VexFlow library.

**Features**

AI-Powered Music Analysis: Analyze and solve metric problems in AI-generated music.
Music Notation Rendering: Render music notation directly in the browser using VexFlow.
Robust Backend: Built with Node.js and MongoDB for scalable and efficient data handling.
Modern Frontend: Transitioning to TypeScript for enhanced code reliability and maintainability.
Extensible Architecture: Designed to easily incorporate new features and integrations.
Technologies Used

JavaScript: Primary programming language.
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
MongoDB: Database for storing music data.
PHP: Used for legacy support and specific backend functionalities.
TypeScript: In progress for codebase transcription.
VexFlow: Library for music notation rendering.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

Node.js and npm installed.
MongoDB set up and running.

Using VexFlow
VexFlow is a powerful library that allows for rendering music notation in the browser. Below is a guide on how to integrate and use VexFlow within this project.
VexFlow
VexFlow is an open-source library for rendering music notation. It is written in TypeScript (compiled to ES6), and outputs scores to HTML Canvas and SVG. It works in browsers and also in Node.js projects (e.g., a command line script to save a score as a PDF).

The guide below refers to VexFlow 4.2. If you need to work with the previous version, follow the version 3.0.9 tutorial. To follow the current work on VexFlow 5, see https://github.com/vexflow/vexflow.

Quick Start
The quickest way to add VexFlow to a web page is via a <script> tag.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vexflow@4.2.2/build/cjs/vexflow.js"></script>
<script>
  // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
</script>
The URL above includes a version number vexflow@x.y.z. Specifying a particular version is good practice, to prevent rare issues with a future update breaking your deployment. During development & testing, feel free to use the latest release by omitting the version number: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vexflow/build/cjs/vexflow.js

If your project uses a bundler, you can install VexFlow from npm:

npm install vexflow

EasyScore
EasyScore is VexFlow's high-level API for creating music notation. On a web page containing a <div id="output"></div>, the following code displays a score:
