Music Metrics Solver Bot
Project Overview
The Music Metrics Solver Bot is a JavaScript application designed to analyze and solve metric problems in music generated by AI. This project is a part of the 2020 GitHub Archive Program and is actively maintained and updated. Our current goal is to enhance the application's functionality by transcribing the existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript, adding new features, and integrating advanced music notation rendering using the VexFlow library.

Features
AI-Powered Music Analysis: Analyze and solve metric problems in AI-generated music.
Music Notation Rendering: Render music notation directly in the browser using VexFlow.
Robust Backend: Built with Node.js and MongoDB for scalable and efficient data handling.
Modern Frontend: Transitioning to TypeScript for enhanced code reliability and maintainability.
Extensible Architecture: Designed to easily incorporate new features and integrations.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: Primary programming language.
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
MongoDB: Database for storing music data.
PHP: Used for legacy support and specific backend functionalities.
TypeScript: In progress for codebase transcription.
VexFlow: Library for music notation rendering.

Using VexFlow
VexFlow is a powerful library that allows for rendering music notation in the browser. Below is a guide on how to integrate and use VexFlow within this project.

Integrating VexFlow
Install VexFlow: VexFlow can be added to your project via npm:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install vexflow
Basic Setup: Import and create a basic setup to render music notation:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import Vex from 'vexflow';

// Create an SVG renderer and attach it to the DIV element named "boo"
const VF = Vex.Flow;
const div = document.getElementById("boo");
const renderer = new VF.Renderer(div, VF.Renderer.Backends.SVG);

// Configure the rendering context
renderer.resize(500, 200);
const context = renderer.getContext();
context.setFont("Arial", 10, "").setBackgroundFillStyle("#eed");

// Create a stave of width 400 at position 10, 40 on the canvas.
const stave = new VF.Stave(10, 40, 400);

// Add a clef and time signature.
stave.addClef("treble").addTimeSignature("4/4");

// Connect it to the rendering context and draw!
stave.setContext(context).draw();
Adding Notes: To render notes on the stave:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Create a voice in 4/4 and add notes
const notes = [
  new VF.StaveNote({ clef: "treble", keys: ["c/4"], duration: "q" }),
  new VF.StaveNote({ clef: "treble", keys: ["d/4"], duration: "q" }),
  new VF.StaveNote({ clef: "treble", keys: ["b/4"], duration: "qr" }),
  new VF.StaveNote({ clef: "treble", keys: ["c/4"], duration: "q" }),
];

// Create a voice and add above notes
const voice = new VF.Voice({ num_beats: 4, beat_value: 4 });
voice.addTickables(notes);

// Format and justify the notes to 400 pixels.
const formatter = new VF.Formatter().joinVoices([voice]).format([voice], 400);

// Render voice
voice.draw(context, stave);
